# User Behavior Classification Based on Mobile Usage Patterns
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify user behavior based on mobile device usage patterns. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various features such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, number of apps installed, and data usage. The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing mobile usage patterns and classifying users into behavioral categories. The machine learning pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment of a user-friendly interface.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling correlations, scaling, and encoding categorical data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and relationships between features.

Model Training: Using supervised learning techniques to classify user behavior.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: A Streamlit-based web app for user input and real-time predictions.

User Input Options:

Upload a CSV file.

Manual entry of feature values.

# Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed redundant features, and scaled the data.

EDA: Correlation analysis and visualization to understand feature relationships.

Feature Selection: Dimensionality reduction and elimination of collinear features.

Model Training: Multiple algorithms evaluated to select the best-performing model.

Deployment: Streamlit app built for user interaction and predictions.
